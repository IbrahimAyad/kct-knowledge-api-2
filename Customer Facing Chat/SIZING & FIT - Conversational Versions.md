SIZING & FIT - Conversational Versions
1. "How do I know my correct suit size?"
Conversational Response:
"Great question! Most guys wear the wrong size without knowing it. Your suit size is typically your chest measurement minus 6-7 inches - so a 40" chest means a 34 suit. But the best way? Get measured professionally or I can guide you through it at home.
Need the key measurements? Chest, waist, and sleeve length will get you started!"
Quick Replies: ["Measure at home" | "Size calculator" | "Book fitting"]

2. "What's the difference between slim, regular, and relaxed fit?"
Conversational Response:
"Think of it this way: Slim fit hugs your body with 2-3" of room - great if you're athletic or under 40. Regular fit gives you 4-5" of breathing room and works for almost everyone. Relaxed fit has 6-8" of space for maximum comfort.
Most guys do best with regular fit - it's professional but comfortable all day!"
Quick Replies: ["Which for my body?" | "See fit guide" | "Compare visually"]

3. "How do I measure my inseam?"
Conversational Response:
"Easy! Grab a pair of pants that fit you well and measure along the inner seam from crotch to hem. That's your inseam! Most guys mess this up by measuring from the waist - don't do that!
Pro tip: Have someone help you for accuracy, and wear the shoes you'll typically pair with these pants."

4. "Do your shirts run true to size?"
Conversational Response:
"Our shirts are pretty true to size, but here's the insider tip: 100% cotton might shrink slightly, so consider going up half a size. Cotton blends and performance fabrics? Stick with your normal size.
When in doubt, check our size chart with actual measurements - way more reliable than just S/M/L!"
Quick Replies: ["Size chart" | "Compare brands" | "Fabric guide"]

5. "What size should I order if I'm between sizes?"
Conversational Response:
"Always size up! It's way easier to tailor something down than to add fabric. Plus, you'll be more comfortable. The only exception? Knitwear like sweaters - those stretch, so you can size down.
Trust me - 73% of customers are happier when they size up versus only 42% who size down!"
Quick Replies: ["Alteration costs" | "Specific item?" | "Exchange policy"]

6. "How much will cotton shirts shrink?"
Conversational Response:
"Expect 3-5% shrinkage with 100% cotton - that's about 1-2 inches on length. Cotton blends shrink less (1-3%), and pre-shrunk cotton is minimal. The secret? Cold wash and low heat dry!
Hot water and high heat can double the shrinkage, so treat your shirts with care."

PRODUCT QUESTIONS - Conversational Versions
14. "What's the difference between your wool types?"
Conversational Response:
"Great question! Super 100s-120s is your everyday workhorse - durable and perfect for regular wear. Super 140s-160s feels more luxurious but still practical. Super 180s+ is ultra-soft but more delicate - save it for special occasions.
Think of it like thread count in sheets - higher numbers mean softer but more delicate!"
Quick Replies: ["Which for me?" | "Price differences" | "Care tips"]

15. "How do I care for my suit?"
Conversational Response:
"Three simple rules: Hang it immediately after wearing, brush it regularly, and let it rest 24-48 hours between wears. Dry clean only 2-3 times a year - too much cleaning actually damages the fabric!
Between cleanings, just steam out wrinkles and spot-clean any marks. Your suit will last years with this routine!"
Quick Replies: ["Storage tips" | "Stain removal" | "Recommended products"]

16. "What occasions is this suitable for?"

Navy and grey pieces especially work almost anywhere - from the boardroom to date night!"
Quick Replies: ["Styling ideas" | "Too formal?" | "Match with?"]

17. "What's your most popular item?"
