## Service Architecture

### Initialization Sequence
```
1. Core Services (Colors, Validation, etc.)
2. Knowledge Bank Services
3. System Health Services
4. Fashion-CLIP Services
5. Phase 2 Intelligence Services ← NEW
```

### Service Dependencies
- Customer Psychology Service ← **Standalone**
- Career Intelligence Service ← **Uses Body Language Data**
- Venue Intelligence Service ← **Standalone**
- Cultural Adaptation Service ← **Standalone**

### Caching Strategy
- **TTL-based caching**: 1-8 hours depending on data volatility
- **Tag-based invalidation**: Organized by service type
- **Compression**: Large datasets compressed in cache
- **Cache-aside pattern**: Fallback to default data on cache miss

## API Integration Examples

### Enhanced Recommendations with Intelligence
```bash
POST /api/recommendations
{
  "suit_color": "navy",
  "customer_profile": "classic_conservative",
  "customer_id": "12345",              # Enables psychology analysis
  "session_duration": 180000,          # 3 minutes
  "choices_viewed": 15,                # Psychology factors
  "venue_type": "wedding",             # Enables venue optimization
  "lighting_conditions": ["mixed"],    # Venue intelligence
  "cultural_region": "north_america"   # Cultural adaptation
}
```

### Psychology Analysis
```bash
POST /api/v2/intelligence/psychology/analyze
{
  "customer_id": "12345",
  "session_duration": 300000,
  "choices_viewed": 25,
  "current_journey_stage": "decision_making"
}
```

### Career Trajectory Analysis
```bash
GET /api/v2/intelligence/career/trajectory/12345?current_role=analyst&industry=finance&age_range=25-35
```
