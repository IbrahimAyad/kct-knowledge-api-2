## FAQ Questions for Featured Snippets

1. **"What is the best fabric for a spring wedding suit?"**
   > Tropical weight wool (7-9 oz) offers the ideal balance of breathability, structure, and wrinkle resistance for spring weddings. Linen is best for casual outdoor ceremonies, while cotton works for semi-formal events.

2. **"Can I wear a linen suit to a formal spring wedding?"**
   > Linen suits are better suited for semi-formal or casual spring weddings. For formal events, tropical weight wool maintains a more polished appearance while still keeping you cool.

3. **"How late is too late to get a prom tuxedo?"**
   > You can secure a prom tuxedo up to 3-5 days before prom using in-stock options and express alterations, though 4-6 weeks is ideal for custom orders and proper fitting.

4. **"What color suit should I wear for Easter 2026?"**
   > Light blue, mint green, lavender, light gray, and classic navy are top Easter suit colors for 2026. Pastel shades photograph beautifully for family photos and align with spring themes.

   > Yes, approximately 60-70% of guys change into more casual attire (jeans, casual shirt, comfortable shoes) for prom after-parties, especially if activities involve bowling, movies, or active entertainment.

6. **"What should I wear under my graduation gown?"**
   > Wear a complete suit (jacket, dress shirt, tie, dress pants) under your graduation gown, as the top half will show in photos and during processional. Focus on comfort with lightweight fabrics since ceremonies are often long.

### Seasonal Fabric Guide

**Temperature-Appropriate Fabrics:**
| Temperature | Recommended Fabrics |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 60-70°F | Mid-weight wool (9-11 oz), cotton twill, lightweight flannel |

- Unlined or half-lined jackets dramatically improve comfort for outdoor events

**Wrinkle Considerations:**
