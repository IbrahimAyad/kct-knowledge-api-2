Position fresco wool as **the underrated summer suit fabric**. Address misconception "wool = hot" with weave science.

**What IS Fresco Wool:**
High-quality tropical wool featuring an open, porous weave engineered for hot climates. Named after Italian word *affresco* (meaning "fresh").

**Construction Science:**
- Close-twisted, tightly spun wool fibers create sleek texture
- Open weave (not tight/dense) allows air circulation
- Rivals linen's breathability; surpasses it in wrinkle-resistance

**Fresco vs. Linen Comparison:**

| Feature | Fresco Wool | Linen |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Breathability | Exceptional (open weave) | Superior (natural fiber) |
| Wrinkle Resistance | Excellent | Poor |
| Formality | Formal (maintains structure) | Semi-formal to casual |
| Drape | Excellent | Good |
| Durability | Exceptional | Moderate |
| Travel-Friendly | Yes | Moderate |
| Price Point | Premium ($500-1,000+) | Mid-range ($300-600) |
| Best For | Formal summer weddings | Casual/semi-formal beach |

**Why Fresco Wool > Linen for Formal Events:**
1. Structure maintenance in humidity
2. Professional appearance maintained
3. Superior durability
4. Greater versatility
5. Easier care

**When to Choose Fresco Over Linen:**
- ✅ Formal or black-tie summer weddings
- ✅ Business events requiring polish
- ✅ Multiple-event destinations
- ✅ Buyers who hate wrinkled aesthetic
- ✅ Travel-heavy customers
- ✅ Grooms/groomsmen

**Investment Positioning:**
One fresco suit = 5-10 years of wearability; cost per wear favors fresco.

**Search Intent:** Informational (55%) + Commercial (45%)

Create **garden wedding attire authority guide**. Navigate the balance: garden weddings are inherently semi-formal (relaxed outdoor) but still require polish (wedding occasion).

**Garden Wedding Dress Code Translation:**
- **Garden Formal:** Full suit in soft colors, dress shirt, tie optional, refined footwear
- **Garden Semi-Formal:** Suit or blazer + dress pants, dress shirt, tie optional, loafers
- **Garden Casual:** Blazer + chinos, dress shirt, no tie, leather sneakers/loafers

**Color Psychology for Garden Venues:**

**Top Garden Wedding Colors:**
1. Soft Sage Green (nature-inspired, on-trend 2026)
2. Dove Gray (neutral, photographs beautifully against greenery)
3. Pale Blue (soft, romantic, reflects sky)
4. Sand/Beige (warm, natural, blends with paths)
5. Blush/Dusty Rose (romantic, garden-appropriate)
6. White/Ivory (bold but sophisticated)
7. Light Olive (earthy, modern)

**Avoid:** Dark navy, black, charcoal (too formal, harsh against greenery)

**Footwear for Garden Terrain:**
- Suede loafers (grip on grass, refined aesthetic)
- Brogues with textured sole (traction on slippery surfaces)
- Leather sneakers (if explicitly casual)
- **Avoid:** Patent leather, smooth leather dress shoes, sandals

**The Open-Collar Question:**
- ✅ Open collar if: daytime, "garden party" dress code, temp above 80°F
- ❌ Wear tie if: evening reception, formal wedding, in wedding party

**Photography Considerations:**
- Golden hour: Soft colors (blush, sand, pale blue) glow beautifully
- Bright daylight: Sage green, dove gray photograph exceptionally
- Against foliage: Light colors pop; dark colors disappear

## FAQ Questions for Featured Snippets

1. **"What is the best fabric for a suit in extreme heat?"**
   > Fresco wool, linen, and linen blends are ideal. Fresco wool maintains structure while providing exceptional breathability; linen offers maximum airflow but wrinkles naturally.

2. **"Can you wear a wool suit in 95-degree weather?"**
   > Yes, if it's fresco wool or tropical weight wool with an open weave. These specialized wools breathe nearly as well as linen while maintaining wrinkle-resistance.

3. **"Is linen suit appropriate for a formal wedding?"**
   > Linen suits work for semi-formal or casual outdoor weddings but are generally too relaxed for formal ceremonies. Fresco wool is better for formality.

4. **"What should I wear to a tropical destination wedding?"**
   > Lightweight linen or fresco wool suits in light colors (white, cream, beige). Guayabera shirts with linen pants are appropriate formal wear for Caribbean/Latin American destinations.

5. **"What is the best suit color for a garden wedding?"**
   > Soft, natural colors like sage green, dove gray, pale blue, and beige harmonize with garden settings. Avoid dark navy or black.

6. **"How far in advance should I buy an August wedding suit?"**
   > Order immediately if purchasing in July. In-stock suits can be tailored in 7-10 days; made-to-measure requires 4-6 weeks.
