Position seersucker as the **underutilized summer suit secret**. Address myths: "too preppy," "old-fashioned," "costume-like"—debunk with modern styling.

**Why Seersucker Works (Science + Style):**
- **Cooling technology:** Puckered weave creates air pockets, lifts fabric off skin
- **Breathability:** Less fabric-to-skin contact = cooler than linen in some cases
- **Wrinkle concealment:** Textured surface naturally hides wrinkles
- **Visual interest:** Texture adds dimension

**Modern Seersucker Colors Beyond Classic Blue/White:**
- Petrol / Navy Solid (sophisticated, less "country club")
- Sand / Beige (neutral elegance)
- Dark Blue solid (contemporary, less traditional)
- Pastel Stripes (lavender, blush pink, mint green)
- Gray Stripes (subtler, more professional)

**When Seersucker Is Appropriate:**
- ✅ Semi-formal outdoor weddings, garden parties, beach ceremonies, daytime receptions
- ⚠️ Formal evening weddings (depends on venue)
- ❌ Black-tie required, ultra-formal indoor weddings

**Seersucker vs. Linen Comparison:**
| Feature | Seersucker | Linen |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Breathability | Excellent (air pockets) | Exceptional (natural fiber) |
| Wrinkle Resistance | Good (texture hides) | Poor (wrinkles easily) |
| Formality Level | Semi-formal max | Semi-formal to casual |
| Travel-Friendliness | Excellent | Moderate |

**Beach Wedding Dress Code Translation:**
- **Beach Formal:** Lightweight suit, dress shirt (tie optional), dress shoes or refined loafers
- **Beach Semi-Formal:** Suit separates, dress shirt (no tie), loafers or boat shoes
- **Beach Casual:** Dress pants + dress shirt (no jacket), open collar, dressy sandals

- Best for: Semi-formal beach weddings, evening receptions

**Seersucker (Dark Horse):**
- ✅ Uniquely cooling, hides wrinkles, travel-friendly
- ❌ Very casual aesthetic, less common
- Best for: Garden-party-adjacent beach venues

**Top Beach Wedding Suit Colors:**
1. Beige/Tan/Sand (most popular, blends with beach aesthetic)
2. Light Gray/Stone (more formal, still beach-appropriate)
3. Light Blue (coastal vibe, photographs beautifully)

5. Sage Green (nature-inspired, trendy 2026)

## FAQ Questions for Featured Snippets

1. **"What is the best suit color for a June wedding?"**
