# KCT Menswear – March 2026 Editorial Calendar

## Month Overview

### Key Buying Moments

March 2026 represents a **critical pivot month** for menswear formalwear retailers, sitting at the intersection of two major revenue streams: **peak prom season preparation** (with most proms occurring April-May) and the **official start of wedding season**.

- High school students finalizing prom tuxedo selections 2-3 months before events
- Spring/summer grooms and groomsmen beginning serious suit shopping for May-October ceremonies
- National Prom Day falls on **March 31, 2026**

### Seasonal Focus

**Weather & Styling Context:** March marks the transition from winter to spring (equinox March 21).

- **Temperature considerations:** Layering options, transitional fabrics (wool blends vs. linen), breathable materials
- **Color psychology:** Lighter tones emerge (sage green, dusty blue, light gray, pastels)
- **Event urgency:** Both prom shoppers and wedding parties face imminent deadlines

**Buyer Mindset:** High commercial intent—past browsing phase, ready to purchase.
