- **Weather reality**: Significantly cooler (40-60°F in most regions), potential snow in northern states
- **Foliage status**: Trees mostly bare (peak foliage passed)
- **Venue shift**: More indoor ceremonies due to cold

**Timeline Urgency for November Weddings:**
If shopping in late October for November wedding:
- **Custom orders**: Too late (need 4-6 weeks minimum)
- **In-stock suits**: Still viable with rush alterations
- **Made-to-measure**: Cutting it close (expedited production possible)

**November Suit Colors (Late Fall Transition):**

**Deeper, Richer Than October:**
- **Deep burgundy/wine**: Darker than October burgundy (richer, more winter-leaning)
- **Chocolate brown**: Deeper than caramel (substantial warmth)
- **Charcoal/slate gray**: Cooler tones appropriate for gray November skies
- **Deep forest green**: Darker than olive (moody elegance)
- **Navy (almost black)**: Extremely dark navy approaching midnight

**Avoid in November:**
- Light gray, beige, tan (too summery for late fall)
- Bright fall colors (rust, bright orange) without deep tones
- Pastels (completely wrong season)

**Fabric Weight for November:**
- **Medium to heavy wool**: 11-14 oz (substantial warmth)
- **Flannel**: Perfect weight for November temperatures
- **Tweed**: Ideal for outdoor photos in cold weather
- **Velvet**: Luxe texture for evening November weddings
- **Avoid**: Lightweight tropical wool, linen, cotton (too cold)
