## What Southwest Michigan Customers Are Saying:

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Best Tailor in Kalamazoo!"**
*"I've been to several tailors in the area and KCT is by far the best. They altered my wedding suit perfectly—sleeves, pants hem, waist taken in. Fit like a glove on my wedding day. The tailor really knows what they're doing. Will be back for all my alterations!"*  
— Michael R., Kalamazoo, MI

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Saved My Bridesmaid Dress!"**
*"Ordered my bridesmaid dress online and it was way too long. Brought it to KCT at the mall in Portage and they hemmed it perfectly in just 5 days. Price was very reasonable ($35) and the hem was invisible. Super happy with their work!"*  
— Jennifer L., Portage, MI

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Same-Day Zipper Replacement!"**
*"My pants zipper broke the morning of an important interview. Called KCT in a panic and they said bring it in. Fixed the zipper same day—I picked it up 4 hours later! Saved my interview. Can't thank them enough!"*  
— David K., Mattawan, MI

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Professional Wedding Dress Alterations"**
*"My wedding dress needed a lot of work—hem, bustle, taking in the bodice, and shortening straps. KCT did an amazing job. Multiple fittings, attention to detail, and the dress fit perfectly. They really know what they're doing with bridal gowns. Highly recommend!"*  
— Ashley M., Kalamazoo, MI

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Affordable & Fast!"**
*"Got 3 pairs of pants hemmed for $45 total—great price! Had them back in 3 days, perfect length. So much better than trying to do it myself. Will definitely use KCT for all my alterations going forward."*  
— Sarah T., Parchment, MI

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Leather Jacket Repair Expert"**
*"Had a vintage leather jacket with a broken zipper and torn pocket. KCT replaced the zipper and repaired the pocket beautifully. You can't even tell it was damaged. They really know how to work with leather!"*  
— James B., Battle Creek, MI
