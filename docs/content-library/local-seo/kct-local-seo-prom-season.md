## Complete Prom Style Guide 2026

### **Prom Suits vs. Tuxedos: What's the Difference?**

**Tuxedos:**
- Satin or grosgrain lapels (shiny)
- Satin stripe down pant leg
- Typically worn with bow tie
- More formal, black-tie look
- Best for: Elegant formal proms, matching classic date dresses

**Suits:**
- Same fabric throughout (no satin)
- Modern versatile look
- Can wear regular tie or bow tie
- Can be any color
- Best for: Modern proms, standing out, rewearing to other events

**Our Recommendation:**
- Traditional formal prom → Tuxedo
- Modern/trendy prom → Suit
- Want to stand out → Colored suit
- Want to rewear → Suit (more versatile)
- Date in classic gown → Tuxedo
- Date in modern/trendy dress → Suit

### **How to Choose Your Prom Color**

**Step 1: Consider Your Date's Dress**
- Ask her dress color early
- Get photo or fabric swatch if possible
- Plan to *complement*, not match exactly

**Step 2: Consider Your Personality**
- Bold and confident → Red, emerald, royal blue
- Classic and timeless → Black, navy, charcoal
- Fashion-forward → Velvet, sequins, unique colors
- Understated cool → Gray, light blue, tan

**Step 3: Consider Your School Colors**
- Some students coordinate with school pride
- Example: Portage Central Mustangs → Blue and white
- Example: Kalamazoo Central Maroon Giants → Maroon/burgundy

**Step 4: Consider Your Friend Group**
- Going with squad? Coordinate colors together
- Each person different complementary color
- Example: Burgundy, emerald, navy, royal blue together

### **Accessorizing Your Prom Look**

**Essential Accessories:**
- **Tie or Bow Tie**: Match or complement date's dress
- **Pocket Square**: Accent color (can match tie or contrast)
- **Belt**: Match shoe color (black shoes = black belt, brown = brown)
- **Dress Shoes**: Polished oxfords, loafers, or fashion sneakers
- **Watch**: Clean simple watch (not too flashy)
- **Cufflinks**: If wearing French cuff shirt (adds class)

**Optional Accessories:**
- **Suspenders**: Vintage cool (especially with bow tie)
- **Vest**: Adds dimension and formality
- **Boutonniere**: Coordinate with date's corsage
- **Jewelry**: Simple chain or bracelet (keep subtle)
- **Sunglasses**: For pre-prom photos (aviators, wayfarers)
- **Hat**: Fedora or newsboy cap (for photos, not during prom)

**Accessories to Avoid:**
- Oversized chains or medallions (looks costume-y)
- Multiple rings (1-2 max, keep simple)
- Visible branded logos (unless designer statement piece)
- Athletic watches or fitness trackers (wear dress watch)
- Phone in jacket pocket (use pants pocket or date's purse)

### **Prom Fit Guide**

**How Should Your Prom Suit/Tux Fit?**

**Jacket:**
- **Shoulders**: Seam sits right on shoulder edge (not drooping off)
- **Length**: Covers your seat, bottom of jacket at knuckles
- **Sleeves**: End at wrist bone, show 1/4-1/2 inch of shirt cuff
- **Chest**: Fits snug but can button comfortably (one fist inside when buttoned)
- **Waist**: Slight taper from chest to waist (not boxy)

**Pants:**
- **Waist**: Fits at natural waist (not sagging)
- **Length**: Breaks at shoe (slight crease on top of shoe) OR no break (modern)
- **Seat**: Fits smoothly over butt (not baggy, not too tight)
- **Thighs**: Comfortable with slight taper to ankle
- **Hem**: Covers shoe laces, doesn't drag on ground

**Shirt:**
- **Collar**: Fits around neck comfortably (two fingers between neck and collar)
- **Sleeves**: End at wrist bone
- **Body**: Fits smoothly, not too tight or baggy
- **Length**: Long enough to stay tucked in all night

**Shoes:**

— Tyler M., Portage Central High School, Class of 2026

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Matched My Girlfriend's Dress Perfectly"**

— Marcus J., Kalamazoo Central High School, Class of 2025

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Saved Me Last Minute!"**

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Best Prom Store in Southwest Michigan"**

— Cameron L., Portage Northern High School, Class of 2025

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Mom Approved LOL"**
