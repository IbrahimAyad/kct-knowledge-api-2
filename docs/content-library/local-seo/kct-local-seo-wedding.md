### **5. Group Fitting Service (Groomsmen Made Easy)**

Planning a wedding is stressful. Coordinating 5-8 groomsmen shouldn't be. **KCT Menswear's Group Fitting Service** makes groomsmen coordination effortless.

**Step 2: Everyone Gets Measured**
- Professional measurement of every groomsman
- Try on sample suits/tuxedos in chosen color/style
- Ensure everyone comfortable with fit/look
- Place orders all at once (no individual appointments needed)

**Step 3: Individual Fittings (If Needed)**
- Each groomsman returns for final fitting 2-3 weeks before wedding
- Final alterations completed
- Everything ready for pickup 3-4 days before wedding

**Step 4: Pickup**
- Groom + groomsmen pick up suits/tuxedos together OR individually
- Final check to ensure everything perfect
- We provide care instructions, return info (if rental)

**Group Fitting Benefits:**
- **Time-efficient:** One appointment vs. 8 individual appointments
- **Consistent styling:** Everyone sees each other, ensure cohesive look
- **Fun experience:** Bachelor party vibes, make it an event

A: **Both locations offer identical services**, so choose based on convenience:

**Q: Do you offer at-home or venue fittings?**
A: For large wedding parties (10+ groomsmen) or special circumstances, we can arrange **on-site group fittings** at your venue or home. Contact us to discuss options and pricing.

### **About Timing & Reservations:**

**Q: How far in advance should I book?**
A: **3-6 months is ideal** for most weddings. However:
- **Peak season weddings** (June, July, September, October): Book 6-9 months ahead
- **Made-to-measure/custom:** Requires 4-6 weeks production (book 5-6 months ahead)
- **Large wedding parties** (8+ groomsmen): Book early to guarantee group fitting availability
- **Last-minute** (under 3 months): We can accommodate! Call for in-stock availability.

**Q: What if my groomsmen live out of town?**
A: No problem! We offer several solutions:
- **Remote measurement instructions:** We send detailed measurement guides, groomsmen measure at home, we verify at pickup
- **Partner shop fittings:** If groomsmen near other cities, we can coordinate with partner shops for measurements
- **Pickup flexibility:** Out-of-town groomsmen can pick up suits 1-2 days before wedding
- **Shipping available:** We can ship rentals/purchases to out-of-state groomsmen (additional fee)

**Q: What happens if someone needs a last-minute size change?**
A: We keep backup sizes in stock during wedding season. If a groomsman's size changes before the wedding:
- **Rentals:** We swap size free of charge (if available)
- **Purchases:** We offer rush alterations (additional fee, based on timeline)
- **Emergency service:** Same-day alterations available for critical situations

### **About Rental vs. Purchase:**

**Q: Should I rent or buy my wedding suit?**
A: Consider these factors:

**Rent if:**
- You'll only wear it once (no future formal events planned)
- You're on a tight budget (rental = $150-300 vs. purchase $400-1,200)
- You prefer not to store formalwear
- You're choosing very trendy colors/styles you won't rewear

**Buy if:**
- You'll wear it again (future weddings, job interviews, formal events)
- You want perfect custom fit (made-to-measure)
- You're choosing classic colors (navy, charcoal, brown = rewearable)
- You value investment pieces (quality suit lasts 10+ years)

*Our recommendation: Grooms usually purchase (rewearability), groomsmen usually rent (one-time wear).*

**Q: Can groomsmen mix rentals and purchases?**
A: Yes! It's common for some groomsmen to purchase (especially those who'll rewear) while others rent. As long as everyone orders the same color/style, it's indistinguishable.

### **About Pricing & Payments:**

**Q: What's included in rental price?**
A: Our rental packages include:
- Jacket
- Pants
- Dress shirt
- Tie or bow tie
- Vest or cummerbund (if applicable)
- All basic alterations
- Garment bag
- Return instructions

*Shoes can be added ($30-50) or wear your own.*

**Q: What's included in purchase price?**
A: Purchased suits/tuxedos include:
- Jacket and pants
- Free basic alterations (sleeve, hem, waist)
- Garment bag
- Future alteration discounts (if you gain/lose weight, we'll adjust)

*Shirts, ties, accessories, shoes sold separately or as package.*

**Q: What forms of payment do you accept?**
A: We accept:
- Credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover)
- Cash
- Checks (with valid ID)

**Purchases:**
- 50% deposit when ordering
- Remaining 50% due at final fitting
- Made-to-measure: Full payment required when ordering (non-refundable custom orders)

### **About Alterations & Fit:**

**Q: Are alterations really included?**
A: **Yes!** Basic alterations included with every rental and purchase:
- Jacket sleeve length
- Pant hem length
- Waist adjustments (within reason—2" max take-in or let-out)

*Complex alterations (shoulder adjustments, jacket length, extensive reconstruction) may incur additional fees.*

- **Basic alterations:** 3-5 business days
- **Complex alterations:** 1-2 weeks
- **Rush service available:** Same-day or next-day (additional $50-100 fee)

*We recommend final fitting 2-3 weeks before wedding to allow alteration time.*

A: **We guarantee your fit.** If you're not satisfied with alterations:
- Come back for re-fitting (no charge)
- We'll adjust until it's perfect
- If timing is tight, we prioritize your adjustments

*We've been tailoring in Kalamazoo for 41 years—we get it right!*

### **About Wedding Day Logistics:**

**Q: When should we pick up suits/tuxedos?**
A: **3-4 days before your wedding** (ideal timing):
- **Why 3-4 days:** Allows time to try on at home, catch any last issues, have emergency alterations if needed
- **Too early:** We don't recommend pickup more than 1 week ahead (wrinkles, potential damage)
- **Too late:** Day-before pickup risky (no time for issues)

*For Saturday weddings, pickup Wednesday or Thursday is perfect.*

**Q: Can we pick up suits at different times?**
A: Yes! Groom and groomsmen don't need to pick up together:
- Groom can pick up early (get comfortable with his suit)
- Groomsmen can pick up individually or in groups
- Out-of-town groomsmen can pick up day-before

*We're flexible—just communicate pickup plans with us ahead of time.*

**Q: What if someone damages their rental?**
A: **Minor wear is expected** (we clean and press between rentals), but damage costs may apply:
- **Stains:** Wine, food, grass stains usually cleanable (no charge if cleanable)
- **Tears/rips:** Damage fee based on severity ($25-150)
- **Lost items:** Missing pieces (tie, cufflinks, etc.) charged at replacement cost
- **Damage waiver available:** $25/person = covers all damage (recommended for bachelor parties!)

**Q: When do rentals need to be returned?**
A: **The business day after your wedding:**
- **Saturday wedding → Return Monday**
- **Sunday wedding → Return Tuesday**
- **Friday wedding → Return Monday**

*Late returns incur $50/day late fee. We provide prepaid return bags—just drop off at our store or UPS.*

### **About COVID/Health Protocols:**

**Q: What health/safety measures do you have?**
A: We maintain high cleanliness standards:
- All rental items professionally cleaned/sanitized between uses
- Fitting rooms sanitized after each appointment
- Private appointments available (one party at a time)
- Contactless pickup/return options
- Staff maintains hygiene protocols

*Your health and safety are our priority!*

### **About Style & Coordination:**

**Q: Can you help us choose colors based on our venue?**
A: **Absolutely—it's one of our specialties!** Tell us:
1. Your wedding venue
2. Bride's dress color
3. Bridesmaid dress colors
4. Wedding date (season affects color recommendations)
5. Your style preferences

*We'll recommend groom/groomsmen colors that complement your venue aesthetic and bridal party.*

- Color coordination advice
- Fabric recommendations based on season/venue
- Fit guidance (what works for your body type)

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Perfect for Our Blue Heron Barn Wedding!"**
*"We got married at Blue Heron Barn and KCT helped us nail the rustic elegance vibe. My husband wore a chocolate brown three-piece suit and his groomsmen wore tan and sage green. The earth tones photographed beautifully against the barn. The staff knew exactly what would work for our venue because they've outfitted tons of barn weddings. Highly recommend!"*  
— Sarah M., Kalamazoo, MI (Married at Blue Heron Barn, September 2024)

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Made Our Radisson Wedding Elegant and Easy"**
*"Planning a ballroom wedding at the Radisson, we wanted classic elegance. KCT set up a group fitting for all 8 groomsmen at their downtown location (so convenient—just blocks from our venue!). Everyone looked sharp in matching navy tuxedos and the groom stood out in a burgundy velvet tux. The custom tailoring was flawless. Can't thank them enough!"*  
— Michael T., Portage, MI (Married at Radisson Plaza Hotel, June 2024)

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Saved Us When Our Suits Didn't Arrive!"**
*"Our suits from an online company never showed up 10 days before the wedding—total panic! Called KCT and they had us in the next day. They had in-stock rentals in our sizes, did rush alterations same-day, and everything was ready in 3 days. They literally saved our wedding. Forever grateful to the team at the Portage location!"*  
— Jason K., Mattawan, MI (Married at Vintage Rose Barn, October 2024)

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Customization Made It Special"**
*"I wanted my wedding suit to be unique, not a rental everyone else has. KCT's made-to-measure service was perfect—I chose emerald green velvet, custom lining with our wedding date embroidered, and monogrammed cuffs. It fit like a glove and I'll wear it forever. Worth every penny!"*  
— David L., Kalamazoo, MI (Married at Henderson Castle, November 2024)

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **"Great with Out-of-Town Groomsmen"**
*"Half our groomsmen lived out of state. KCT sent measurement instructions to everyone, coordinated sizes remotely, and had everything ready for pickup the Wednesday before our Saturday wedding. Two groomsmen needed quick adjustments and they turned them around in 24 hours. So professional and accommodating!"*  
— Chris B., Portage, MI (Married at Fetzer Center, August 2024)
